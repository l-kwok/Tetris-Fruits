# Simple C++ Raytracer

In this project, the goal was to build a game that combines the rules of Tetris and Falling Fruits. Similar to Tetris, pieces from the top of the screen appear and fall towards the bottom. Upon completing a line across the screen, the row is deleted, and everything is shifted downwards. Additionally, if three colours in a row, column, or diagonal match, they are also removed and the pieces above are shifted downwards. The game is finished when the pieces reach the top of the game area.
